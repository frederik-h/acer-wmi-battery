# acer-wmi-battery

## Description

This repository contains an experimental Linux kernel driver for the
battery health control WMI interface of Acer laptops.  It can be used
to control two battery-related features of Acer laptops that Acer
provides through the Acer Care Center on Windows: a health mode that
limits the battery charge to 80% with the goal of preserving your
battery's capacity and a battery calibration mode which puts your
battery through a controlled charge-discharge cycle to provide more
accurate battery capacity estimates. It can also be used to read the
battery temperature.

So far the driver has been reported to work on an Acer Swift 3
(SF314-34), an [Acer Aspire 5 A515-45G-R5A1](https://github.com/linrunner/TLP/issues/596#issuecomment-1146784888),
and an [Acer Enduro N3 Urban (EUN314A-51W)](https://github.com/frederik-h/acer-wmi-battery/issues/4).
Any feedback on how it works on other Acer laptops would be appreciated.

## Building

Make sure that you have the kernel headers for your kernel installed
and type `make` in the cloned project directory. In more detail,
on a Debian or Ubuntu system, you can build by:
```
sudo apt install build-essential linux-headers-$(uname -r) git
git clone https://github.com/frederik-h/acer-wmi-battery.git
cd acer-wmi-battery
make
```

## Using

Loading the module without any parameters does not
change any health or calibration mode settings of your system:

```
sudo insmod acer-wmi-battery.ko
```

### Health mode

The charge limit can then be enabled as follows:
```
echo 1 | sudo tee /sys/bus/wmi/drivers/acer-wmi-battery/health_mode
```

Alternatively, you can enable it at module initialization
time:
```
sudo insmod acer-wmi-battery.ko enable_health_mode=1
```

### Calibration mode

Before attempting the battery calibration, connect
your laptop to a power supply. The calibration mode
can be started as follows:
```
echo 1 | sudo tee /sys/bus/wmi/drivers/acer-wmi-battery/calibration_mode
```

The calibration disables health mode and charges
to 100%. Then it discharges and recharges the battery
once. This can take a long time and for accurate
capacity estimates the laptop should not be used
during this process. After the discharge-charge cycle
the calibration mode should be manually disabled
since the WMI event that indicates the completion
of the calibration is not yet handled by the module:
```
echo 0 | sudo tee /sys/bus/wmi/drivers/acer-wmi-battery/calibration_mode
```

### Battery Temperature

The temperature of the battery in millidegree Celsius can be read as follows:
```
cat /sys/bus/wmi/drivers/acer-wmi-battery/temperature
```

### Related work

There exists [another driver](https://github.com/maxco2/acer-battery-wmi) with
similar functionality of which I have not been aware when starting the work
on this driver. See this [issue](https://github.com/frederik-h/acer-wmi-battery/issues/2) for discussion.
